Our ISP disk (usb/sdcard) is a MBR/FAT32 partition with a file ispbooot.BIN inside.

To test on zebu, we dump the physical disk to bin, then convert it to hex.

1. BootICE: fill secotor #0~131072 to zero in usb disk or sdcard
2. BootICE: create mbr/part1=64M FAT32 (WARINGING: don't use FAT16. iboot only recognize FAT32)
3. Copy ispbooot.BIN into the FAT32 drive
4. BootICE: dump disk sectors=#0~131072 (64MB) to sd64m.bin.raw
5. Find out how many <USED_MB> are used : hexdump -C sd64m.bin.raw
6. dd if=sd64m.bin.raw of=sd64m.bin bs=1M count=<USED_MB>
7. make sd_hex

For this build :
> dd if=disk/sd64m.bin.raw of=disk/sd64m.bin bs=1M count=3
> make sd_hex
--> disk/sd_image.hex
